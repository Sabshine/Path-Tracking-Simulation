# Path Tracking Simulation Branch
This branch makes use of System.Windows.Forms to animated the movement of the following path tracking algoriths:
-Baseline Controller: Only calculates how to get to the next waypoint and steers accordingly.
-Stanley Controller: Ontop of the geometric calculation it works with the crossTrackError.
-Pure Pursuit Controller: Ontop of the geometric calculation it works with the crossTrackError and has a look ahead distance.

## How to run?
Explain here.

## [Improved ??? Branch]()
This branch contains an improved version of the ??? controller. (improved-stanley-simulation)
